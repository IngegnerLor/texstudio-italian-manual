1. Configuring TeXstudio
Before using TeXstudio, you should configure the editor and latex related commands via the "Configure TeXstudio" command in the "Options" menu ("Preferences" under Mac OS X). Note that there are two levels of detail. More advanced or less often used options are only visible if you toggle "Show advanced options" in the lower left corner.

1.1 Configuring the editor
You may change the default encoding for new files ("Configure TeXstudio" -> "Editor" -> "Editor Font Encoding") if you don't want utf8 as encoding. Don't forget to set the same encoding in the preamble of your documents. (e.g. \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, if you use utf-8).
TeXstudio can auto detect utf-8 and latin1 encoded files, but if you use a different encoding in your existing documents you have to specify it in the configuration dialog before opening them. (and then you also have to disable the auto detection)

"Folding" toggles the editors code-folding capability (hide sections of the text).
The selection box "Indentation mode" lets you select, whether indented lines are followed by lines of the same indentation after pressing Enter or letting TeXstudio do automatic indentation.
